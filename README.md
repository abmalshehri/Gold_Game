Creating a game that two  people can play called â€œGold Game"
The application will work as follows:
- Starting with player 1, each player gets a turn at answering five trivia questions. (There are a total of 10 questions).
-When a question is displayed on the console, four possible answers are also displayed. Only one of the answers is correct, and if the player selects the correct answer he or she earns a point.
-After answers have been selected for all the questions, the program displays the number of points earned by each player and declares the player with the highest number of points the winner.
